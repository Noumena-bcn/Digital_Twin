# Digital_Twin

New repository for the Noumena Robotics Digital Twin.

Each directory is briefly described hereafter, and more detailed README files can be found in each of them.

In addition, a guide for building OpenCV with CUDA support for the DNN module is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRDi8voHjlAEyq6xXm3BSpu1nlvRAQ3B0Ip0NqSYwVY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Cams

Inside that folder, you can find the focus of each camera

## yolov4-opencv

General purpose scripts to use [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) with OpenCV's DNN module for object detection.

The output can be stored as a video or as JSON files.
